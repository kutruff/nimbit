# _Nimbit_

A very tiny Typescript type definition, validation, and and reflection library. It's the best parts of Zod and more but very tiny and less noise in your code.

This is in alpha. Still working on validation.

```bash
npm install nimbit
```

### `nimbit`

âœ… Type definitions
âœ… Validation 
âœ… Mutually recursive types
